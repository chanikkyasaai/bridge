# BRIDGE ML-Engine Separate Deployment Summary

## What You Now Have

### âœ… Complete Separate Service Architecture
- **ML-Engine Service**: Independent FastAPI service (`ml_engine_api_service.py`)
- **Backend HTTP Client**: Connects to ML-Engine via REST API (`ml_engine_client.py`)
- **Integration Hooks**: Seamless session lifecycle management (`ml_hooks.py`)
- **Configuration**: Environment-based service discovery and connection

### âœ… Key Files Updated/Created

#### Backend (bridge/backend/)
- **`ml_engine_client.py`** - HTTP client for ML-Engine API communication
- **`ml_hooks.py`** - Integration hooks using HTTP client (replaces direct imports)
- **`.env`** - Added ML-Engine configuration variables
- **`.env.example`** - Template with ML-Engine settings

#### ML-Engine (bridge/ml-engine/)
- **`ml_engine_api_service.py`** - Standalone FastAPI service
- **`start_ml_service.sh`** - Linux/Mac startup script
- **`start_ml_service.bat`** - Windows startup script
- **`Dockerfile`** - Container deployment
- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Docker Compose configuration
- **`README.md`** - Updated with deployment instructions

#### Documentation
- **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Complete deployment guide
- **Configuration examples** - Environment setup for both services

## How to Deploy Right Now

### 1. Start ML-Engine Service

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd bridge\ml-engine
start_ml_service.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cd bridge/ml-engine
chmod +x start_ml_service.sh
./start_ml_service.sh
```

### 2. Configure Backend

Update `bridge/backend/.env`:
```bash
ML_ENGINE_URL=http://localhost:8001
ML_ENGINE_ENABLED=true
ML_ENGINE_TIMEOUT=30
```

### 3. Start Backend

```bash
cd bridge/backend
python main.py
```

### 4. Verify Connection

```bash
# Check ML-Engine health
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Check backend ML integration
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ml/ml-engine/status
```

## Production Deployment

### For Your Hosted Backend

1. **Deploy ML-Engine on separate server/container:**
   ```bash
   # Example production ML-Engine URL
   ML_ENGINE_URL=https://ml-engine.your-domain.com
   ```

2. **Update backend environment:**
   ```bash
   # In your hosted backend's .env
   ML_ENGINE_URL=https://ml-engine.your-domain.com
   ML_ENGINE_ENABLED=true
   ML_ENGINE_API_KEY=your-production-api-key
   ```

3. **Ensure network connectivity:**
   - Backend must be able to reach ML-Engine service
   - Configure firewall rules if needed
   - Use HTTPS in production

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Deploy ML-Engine with Docker
cd bridge/ml-engine
docker-compose up -d

# ML-Engine will be available at http://localhost:8001
```

## Key Benefits

### âœ… Independent Scaling
- Scale ML-Engine independently based on authentication load
- Scale backend independently based on API traffic

### âœ… Independent Updates
- Update ML-Engine without affecting backend
- Deploy new ML models without backend downtime

### âœ… Better Resource Management
- Dedicated resources for ML processing
- Optimized container/server configurations

### âœ… High Availability
- ML-Engine failures don't crash backend
- Graceful degradation when ML-Engine unavailable
- Automatic retry and health checking

## Service Communication Flow

```
User Login â†’ Backend â†’ ML-Engine (session/start)
Behavioral Event â†’ Backend â†’ ML-Engine (session/process-event)
Session End â†’ Backend â†’ ML-Engine (session/end)
```

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### ML-Engine Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Backend ML Integration Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ml/ml-engine/status
```

### Logs to Monitor
- **Backend**: ML-Engine connection status, authentication decisions
- **ML-Engine**: Processing times, session lifecycle, errors

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "ML-Engine not available"
- âœ… Check ML-Engine service is running
- âœ… Verify ML_ENGINE_URL in backend .env
- âœ… Test connectivity between services

### High Latency
- âœ… Check ML-Engine resource usage
- âœ… Consider increasing ML_ENGINE_WORKERS
- âœ… Optimize network between services

### Authentication Failures
- âœ… Verify API keys match
- âœ… Check ML-Engine logs for errors
- âœ… Test ML-Engine endpoints directly

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy ML-Engine** using the provided scripts
2. **Configure backend** with ML-Engine URL
3. **Test the connection** with health checks
4. **Monitor performance** and authentication flow
5. **Scale as needed** based on usage patterns

## Support

- **Full deployment guide**: See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- **Configuration examples**: See updated `.env` files
- **Docker setup**: Use provided Docker files
- **Troubleshooting**: Check logs in both services

---

**Your BRIDGE ML-Engine is now ready for separate deployment!** ðŸš€

The architecture is production-ready with proper error handling, health checks, and graceful degradation when services are unavailable.
